# Autonomous Engineering Governance Rule

This workspace uses the **Autonomous Engineering Governance System** across a 15-stage lifecycle.

## Workspace Auto-Detection & Persistent State Sentinel
At the start of EVERY conversation turn or session reopening:
1. **Check for State Store**: Look for `.zeta/state.json` in the workspace root.
2. **If `.zeta/state.json` exists**:
   - The project is governed by this system.
   - Read `.zeta/state.json` before taking any actions.
   - If the active step is `< 15`, greet the user with the current active stage:
     > *"Welcome back to [Project ID]! Active Stage: Step [X] — [Step Name]."*
   - If there is an `uncommittedBuffer.lastUserMessage`, remind the user of the pending turn.
   - Do NOT bypass the active step or edit code out of order. Enforce the current stage gating.
3. **If `.zeta/state.json` does NOT exist (Greenfield Idea Intake Protocol)**:
   - Do NOT immediately dump rigid archetype options or assume an idea.
   - Greet the user cleanly in 1–2 sentences and invite their idea:
     > *"Welcome to ZETA Greenfield Governance!*  
     > *What idea or problem are you planning to build? (Feel free to share a raw brain-dump, rough thoughts, or problem statement).*  
     > *Tip: If you don't have an idea yet, reply **'Suggest an idea'** and I will ask a few quick questions to brainstorm one with you."*
   - **Path A (User enters a brain-dump / idea)**:
     - Ingest the idea into `.zeta/state.json` with Step 0 active.
     - Dissect the idea, extract core dimensions, and begin Step 0 (Problem Definition & Project Intent) with targeted Top 3 options tailored to their actual concept.
   - **Path B (User requests suggestions / brainstorming)**:
     - If the user asks for suggestions or is unsure, ask targeted discovery questions:
       1. Preferred domain (e.g., developer tools, personal productivity, data utilities, creative tools).
       2. Preferred interface (CLI/terminal, web application, desktop GUI, headless library).
       3. Any specific technologies or constraints they wish to explore.
     - Present Top 3 concrete project concepts with trade-offs.
     - When the user chooses or refines an idea, launch Step 0 with that concept as the foundation.

## Mandatory Response Signature (Active Plugin Indicator)
In EVERY response, prefix the very first line with the active ZETA status badge so the user can verify the governance plugin is attached:
- If steps are in progress: `[⚡ ZETA: ACTIVE | Step [X]/15 - [Step Name]]`
- If all 15 stages are complete: `[⚡ ZETA: ACTIVE | Lifecycle Complete (15/15)]`
If this badge is ever absent, the user knows the governance plugin has been detached or bypassed.
